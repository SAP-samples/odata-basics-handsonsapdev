# Sample app demonstrating some OData annotations

> âš  This document is a work-in-progress

This is the complete app that is built over the series of exercises in the (now archived) [repo for the SAP CodeJam on CAP with Node.js](https://github.com/SAP-archive/cloud-cap-nodejs-codejam). It is included in this repo as it is a good illustration of some basic annotations. In particular, have a look at the annotations in the `index.cds` and `service.cds` files in the `srv/` directory.

## Getting things running

Move to this directory and start things up, like this:

```bash
cd workingapp
cds watch
```

## The annotations

Here's a brief overview of the annotations used in the service which is part of this app. Note that the word "annotation" is used in two different contexts here:

- [Annotations in CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/annotations) in CDS form are used to describe and augment core data service definitions, and are prefixed with the `@` symbol
- [OData annotations](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-vocabularies/v4.0/odata-vocabularies-v4.0.html), organised into [vocabularies](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies), that provide extra information on an OData service's metadata and appear in the EDMX definition (in the `$metadata` document)

When used in an OData context (i.e. when describing an OData service in CDS) the CAP annotations will result in valid OData annotations. These annotations will belong to either standard OData vocabularies, or SAP specific vocabularies.

> Note that "A service MUST NOT require the client to understand custom annotations in order to accurately interpret a response" (see the [Vocabulary Extensibility section of OData Version 4.0. Part 1: Protocol Plus Errata 03](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata03/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata03-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_Toc453752215)). In other words, beyond annotations in the "Core" vocabulary, think of further annotations as suggestions.

### In service.cds

CDS annotation: `@readonly`

Used at the entity level, this CDS annotation generates specific terms in the [OData "Capabilities" vocabulary](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-vocabularies/v4.0/csprd01/odata-vocabularies-v4.0-csprd01.html#_Toc472083030).

Specifically, this line:

`@readonly entity OrderInfo as projection on my.Orders ...`

causes these OData annotation terms to be generated and included in the service metadata document: `DeleteRestrictions`, `InsertRestrictions` and `UpdateRestrictions`.

You can see this for yourself using the `cds` command line tool to generate EDMX for the `Stats` service defined within the `srv/service.cds` file, which looks like this:

```cds
using my.bookshop as my from '../db/schema';

// ...

service Stats {
  @readonly entity OrderInfo as projection on my.Orders excluding {
    createdAt,
    createdBy,
    modifiedAt,
    modifiedBy,
    book,
    country
  }
}
```

This is how you do it:

```bash
cds compile srv --service Stats --to edmx-v4
```

This produces the following output - note the `<Annotations>` element:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<edmx:Edmx Version="4.0" xmlns:edmx="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edmx">
  <edmx:Reference Uri="https://oasis-tcs.github.io/odata-vocabularies/vocabularies/Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.xml">
    <edmx:Include Alias="Capabilities" Namespace="Org.OData.Capabilities.V1"/>
  </edmx:Reference>
  <edmx:DataServices>
    <Schema Namespace="Stats" xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edm">
      <EntityContainer Name="EntityContainer">
        <EntitySet Name="OrderInfo" EntityType="Stats.OrderInfo"/>
      </EntityContainer>
      <EntityType Name="OrderInfo">
        <Key>
          <PropertyRef Name="ID"/>
        </Key>
        <Property Name="ID" Type="Edm.Guid" Nullable="false"/>
        <Property Name="quantity" Type="Edm.Int32"/>
      </EntityType>
      <Annotations Target="Stats.EntityContainer/OrderInfo">
        <Annotation Term="Capabilities.DeleteRestrictions">
          <Record Type="Capabilities.DeleteRestrictionsType">
            <PropertyValue Property="Deletable" Bool="false"/>
          </Record>
        </Annotation>
        <Annotation Term="Capabilities.InsertRestrictions">
          <Record Type="Capabilities.InsertRestrictionsType">
            <PropertyValue Property="Insertable" Bool="false"/>
          </Record>
        </Annotation>
        <Annotation Term="Capabilities.UpdateRestrictions">
          <Record Type="Capabilities.UpdateRestrictionsType">
            <PropertyValue Property="Updatable" Bool="false"/>
          </Record>
        </Annotation>
      </Annotations>
    </Schema>
  </edmx:DataServices>
</edmx:Edmx>
```

These annotation terms basically say - to those consuming apps that can interpret them - that delete, insert or update operations may not be performed on the `OrderInfo` entity.

In case you're wondering - these restrictions that are imposed via the `@readonly` decoration in the CDS definition are actually implemented in CAP.

Assuming that the service is running (with `cds run`) you can try this yourself, like this:

```bash
curl
  --silent \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --include \
  --data '{"quantity": 10}' \
  --url 'http://localhost:4004/stats/OrderInfo'
```

This produces the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
X-Powered-By: Express
x-correlation-id: 3a80f986-2acd-4663-8116-d9b39d532f31

Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
Content-Length: 104

{"error":{"code":"405","message":"Entity \"Stats.OrderInfo\" is read-only","@Common.numericSeverity":4}}
```

Nice!

### In index.cds

In this file you can see the explicit [annotate](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#annotate) directive in action. This is contrast to the previous example, where the `@readonly` annotation was specified directly with the definition of what was being annotated.

```cds
annotate CatalogService.Books with @(
    UI: {
        Identification: [ {Value: title} ],
        SelectionFields: [ title ],
        LineItem: [
            {Value: ID},
            {Value: title},
            {Value: author.name},
            {Value: author_ID},
            {Value: stock}
        ],
        HeaderInfo: {
            TypeName: '{i18n>Book}',
            TypeNamePlural: '{i18n>Books}',
            Title: {Value: title},
            Description: {Value: author.name}
        }
    }
);
```

This example is considerably more involved than the `@readonly` example previously. Let's take it bit by bit. You may also want to refer to the [OData Annotations section of the CAP documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/odata#annotations).

#### OData annotation vocabularies

First, let's consider the simple and single word "readonly", and then what appears to be words ("UI", "Identification", "LineItem", "Value", etc) within a wider syntactical structure in this larger example.

The previous `@readonly` example was a CDS annotation that resulted in the generation of multiple OData annotations.

In this current example, what we're looking at are annotations that are closer to the direct use of the combination of the OData annotation concepts of "vocabulary" and "term". To understand this better, let's start by taking a step back, and staring at the OData annotation vocabularies for a few minutes.

The standards document [OData Vocabularies Version 4.0 Committee Specification / Public Review Draft 01](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-vocabularies/v4.0/odata-vocabularies-v4.0.html) outlines six vocabularies as follows (the summary document [OData specs](https://github.com/qmacro/odata-specs/blob/master/overview.md) provides some information on the different document stages such as "Committee Specification" and "Public Review"):

|Vocabulary|Namespace|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Core|[Org.OData.Core.V1](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md)|Terms describing behavioral aspects along with annotation terms that can be used to define other vocabularies (yes, meta all the things!)|
|Capabilities|[Org.OData.Capabilities.V1](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.md)|Terms that provide a way for service authors to describe certain capabilities of an OData Service|
|Measures|[Org.OData.Measures.V1](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Measures.V1.md)|Terms describing monetary amounts and measured quantities|
|Validation|[Org.OData.Validation.V1](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Validation.V1.md)|Terms describing validation rules|
|Aggregation|[Org.OData.Aggregation.V1](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Aggregation.V1.md)|Terms describing which data in a given entity model can be aggregated, and how|
|Authorization|[Org.OData.Authorization.V1](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Authorization.V1.md)|Terms describing a web authorization flow|

> If you like rabbit-holes, note that all the vocabularies are described in machine-readable format ... using terms in the Core vocabulary. [Even the Core vocabulary itself](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.xml). Don't forget to come back once you've explored!

In the [Introduction](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-vocabularies/v4.0/csprd01/odata-vocabularies-v4.0-csprd01.html#_Toc472083025) section of the standards document, it says that "_Other OData vocabularies may be created, shared, and maintained outside of this work product_".

And so there are other OData annotation vocabularies, for different purposes. SAP has created some, and they are documented publicly in the [SAP/odata-vocabularies](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies) repository on GitHub. Amongst the SAP vocabularies, there are ones called Analytics, Communication, DataIntegration and also one called [Common](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Common.md) which contains terms common for all SAP vocabularies.

#### The UI annotation vocabulary

Another one in that list from SAP is the [UI](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md) vocabulary, containing terms relating to presenting data in user interfaces.

Staring at [the table of Terms](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#terms) in this vocabulary (or any for that matter) will help us interpret the CDS in `index.cds` we saw earlier, in other words, this:

```cds
annotate CatalogService.Books with @( ... );
```

More specifically it will help us to interpret everything inside the `@( ... )`.

Looking at the contents of that table of terms, we see something like this (this excerpt shows just some of the many terms):

Term|Type|Description
:---|:---|:----------
[HeaderInfo](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#L58:~:text=<Term%20Name="-,HeaderInfo,-")|[HeaderInfoType?](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#HeaderInfoType)|<a name="HeaderInfo"></a>Information for the header area of an entity representation. HeaderInfo is mandatory for main entity types of the model
[Identification](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#L109:~:text=<Term%20Name="-,Identification,-")|\[[DataFieldAbstract](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#DataFieldAbstract)\]|<a name="Identification"></a>Collection of fields identifying the object
[Badge](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#L114:~:text=<Term%20Name="-,Badge,-")|[BadgeType?](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#BadgeType)|<a name="Badge"></a>Information usually displayed in the form of a business card
[LineItem](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#L141:~:text=<Term%20Name="-,LineItem,-")|\[[DataFieldAbstract](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#DataFieldAbstract)\]|<a name="LineItem"></a>Collection of data fields for representation in a table or list
[SelectionFields](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#L931:~:text=<Term%20Name="-,SelectionFields,-")|\[PropertyPath\]|<a name="SelectionFields"></a>Properties that might be relevant for filtering a collection of entities of this type


Note that there are terms, and there are types. A term has a value, which is of a certain type.

In the table we can recognize some of the content that we saw [in index.cds](#in-indexcds) as terms in this UI Vocabulary:

- `Identification`
- `SelectionFields`
- `LineItem`
- `HeaderInfo`

Note in each case, the type is a single (camelcased) word. The word may be wrapped in square brackets, which denotes a collection of values of that type.

In the table exerpt above, most of the single words are also hyperlinked. For example, following [HeaderInfoType](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/UI.md#HeaderInfoType) leads to a table of properties that belong to that type, i.e. properties that the type consists of - in other words, the type is a structure (called a record, or object, see later). There's one type in this table exerpt that is not hyperlinked, and that is `PropertyPath`. That's because that type is not a structure, but a single, scalar thing (also called a primitive).

> If you're wondering about the `?` suffix on some of the types, ignore it for now - it doesn't help our understanding that we need here.

With this knowledge, we can now understand, for example, that the value for the `SelectionFields` term is a collection of paths to properties, and that the value for the `HeaderInfo` term is a record of properties including `TypeName`, `TypeNamePlural`, `Title` and so on.

#### Syntax for annotations in CDS

Another aspect that we need to consider when embarking on an attempt to parse the annotations above, is CDS's [annotation syntax](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#annotation-syntax). For any given term in a vocabulary, the annotation is written as follows:

```cds
@vocabulary.term
```

followed by the value for that annotation.

> There are also [qualified annotations](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/odata#qualified-annotations) which you should be aware of, but they're not in play in these examples.

Multiple annotations can be specified in one go by listing them one after another, or, more commonly, by listing them inside a `@( ... )` construct and separating them with commas. We can clearly see this in action in our [index.cds](#in-indexcds) example.

#### Annotation values

The final piece in the puzzle to understanding and interpreting annotation definitions and the EDMX content that is generated is the set of different value types for annotation terms. If you're familiar with the core value types in many programming languages, you'll be at home here. There are:

|Value Type|Alternative Name|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Scalar|Primitive|a string, boolean value or number|
|Object|Record|a collection of name value pairs like this: `{ name1: value1, name2: value2, ... }`|
|Array|Collection|a list of other types, either primitives or records, enclosed in `[ ... ]`|
